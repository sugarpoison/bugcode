# There are two boolean values = true and false.
# Boolean operators work off of true and false.

# = assigns a value.
# == compares two values.  (Will either be true or false)
# > greater than and < less than.
# >= greater than or equal to and <= less than or equal to.
# ! means NOT.
# != checks for inequalities
# 'and' 'or' and 'not' are all boolean operators.
# in Python, True and False have caps.
